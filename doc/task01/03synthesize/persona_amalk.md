# Synthesize
R. is 25 years old and lives in Bern. He's doing his civilian service
at the military in Bern where he is assigned of taking care of
patients at Spitex with a depressive disorder. Because R. is not
specialized in internal medicine, he often has to take care of the
people on a more personal level. This means going for a walk with them or socializing. Even tough this means he is not under a high amount of stress he still needs to document the well-being of the patient. Because the Spitex is old fashioned he needs to manually write everything down by pen and paper. While R. understands the reasoning he would prefer an modern solution to simplify his work.
